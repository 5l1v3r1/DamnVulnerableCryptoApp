  // go for the extra mile: you can detect this is ECB by sending two blocks with the same data
  // if in the output you have the same content two times, that this is ECB
  // Assuming each block as 4 bytes: AAAAAAAA AAAAAAAA and that the output encrypted is: XXXX XXXX
  // since the first and second block are the same, means they were encrypted separately, this is a feature of ECB
  //
  // this vulnerability assumes that you can control part of the content being encrypted, preferably in the beginning of the data
  // Again, lets assume each block has 4bytes and that after your input it will be concatenated the word "test"
  // you start by sending a 3 byte block with the text AAA.
  // Since one byte is missing to complete the block, the 't' from 'test' will be used in the first block
  // So you have AAAt, and lets assume this returns something like: 1234 XXXX XXXX X...
  // now, you generate a request for every single character for the 4th position: AAAA, AAAB... AAAz, etc
  // whenever you get the same output as when you only sent AAA, you know which character generated that encypted content. the 't'
  // And from here on you repeat the same process for all other characters. First you send an AA. then AAAt AABt AAzt, etc
  // and compare the results, untill you have the same result. when you have it you found another char.
  // You can use https://github.com/everping/ECB-Byte-at-a-Time to test this.
  // YOu just need to do a small modification to use http requests, instead of raw tcp socket requests
